In no event shall TERP, or any of the Service Recipients, be obligated under this Agreement and the Entity-Level Service Agreements to pay, in the aggregate in respect of any Quarter, any amount exceeding the Base Management Fee payable for that Quarter, after giving effect to any reductions for Creditable Operating Entity Payments contemplated by Section 7.1.2.
 
7.3   Computation and Payment of Net Base Management Fee
 
7.3.1 The Service Providers or another member of the Service Provider Group will compute each installment of the Net Base Management Fee (including computation of the Base Management Fee Adjustment) as soon as practicable following the end of the Quarter with respect to which such installment is payable, but in any event no later than five Business Days following the end of such Quarter. An invoice setting out such fee payable and a copy of the computations and allocations made (such computations and allocations for informational purposes only) will thereafter promptly be delivered to each Service Recipient by the relevant member of the Service Provider Group upon request. Payment of the Net Base Management Fee for any Quarter (whether in cash, TERP Shares or a combination of cash and TERP Shares) shall be due and payable promptly after the 45th day following the date of such invoice by the relevant Service Recipient. For greater certainty, any Dispute relating to the computation of the Net Base Management Fee or any invoicing thereof shall be resolved in accordance with Article 12.

If TERP elects to pay all or a portion of the Net Base Management Fee in TERP Shares, TERP shall issue, and the applicable Service Provider nominated by Brookfield hereby agrees to acquire, TERP Shares equal to the portion of the Net Base Management Fee elected to be paid in TERP Shares divided by the volume weighted average trading price of a TERP Share for the 90 trading days ending on the date TERP makes such election, provided that no fractional TERP Shares shall be issued, and such number shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number with the remainder payable to the Service Providers in cash. In such case, TERP is directed to apply such payment against the subscription price for such TERP Shares.
 
7.3.3 If TERP elects to pay all or any portion of the Net Base Management Fee for any Quarter in TERP Shares, the Service Recipients shall take or cause to be taken all appropriate action to issue such TERP Shares, including any action required to ensure that such TERP Shares are issued in accordance with applicable Laws and listed on any applicable stock exchanges and public quotation systems.
